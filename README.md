# UrbanSoundClassification
Uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the 10 classes in the urbansound8k dataset
This project consists of training a CNN to classify urban noise from the UrbanSound8k dataset.
After the training is complete, the model will be tested on simialr sounds to the UrbanSound8k from the AudioSet dataset to see 
if the model is generalizable.
